# Welcome to your DevOps Assessment 2 Repo

## What is this code?

This repo is a starting point for your Assessment 2 project. We've included all the required setup for the code to run in Codespaces in the `.devcontainer` folder - please don't touch the files in this folder unless you know exactly what you're doing.

## How do I use this code?

You should use this repo and the Codespaces environment it provides to work on your project for Assessment 2. The development work for this project will be introduced in Workshop 5 in the "TDD Hackathon", and work on deployment of the code will start in Workshop 8, when we start to look at Terraform and AWS integration. You should continue to use this repo when working on your assessment between sessions, and it is this repo that you should submit as part of your Assessment 2 submission.
